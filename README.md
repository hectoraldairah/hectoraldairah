### bit me
Hi! I'm bitbyte, welcome to my Github page. I love to being in the open source movement
following a low-tech lifestyle. I like to play retro games (specially ps1,ps2 and sness),
listen to new interesting music and lifting heavy weights.

#### What I'm doing right now? ðŸ¤™

I'm working as a front-end engineer at Openbank, all the stuff is private 'cause... you know...
Buuut I storage all my personal projects here in Github. From coding exercices to weird websites
or tools to improve my developer experience and hopefully some else.

###  Uses?
Keychron k15, Logitech MX Ergo for mouse and that's it.
NVIM is my editor.
VIM for special ocassions
VSCODE if I'm not using my computers

### Vibe
Retro-futuristic, pixelart, catpuccing as everything, chill, sleepy

Don't wait to feel better to do things. You'll need to do things to feel better.
